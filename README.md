# SICP-Racket

Reading through the wonderful [SICP Textbook](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) Scheme


### [Chapter 1 - Building Abstractions with Procedures](Chapter_1_Abstractions_with_Procedures)

This chapter felt very much like an introduction to programming. Lots of philosophical discussions of the differences between data and logic - things of that sort. But there is also a nice introduction to Scheme here. And it was all a joy to read (most textbooks aren't this readable).

### [Chapter 2 - Chapter_2_Abstractions_with_Data](Chapter_2_Abstractions_with_Data)

More waxing philosophic about the nature of data vs code. Very enjoyable. A wonderful introduction to data-driven software. Not just a good description of lists and trees, but also the kinds of decisions that need to be made when trying to design code to solve a more general problem. A great introduction to thinking like an engineer. Hell, it even introduced compression algorithms.

### Chapter 3

> TODO: I expect a combination approach to states and stateful programming (most programming, really), but also an introduction to objects and modular program design.

### Chapter 4

> TODO: I am expecting to write my own LISP. Which [I did once in Python](https://github.com/theJollySin/slowloris), but this should be more thorough and fun!

### Chapter 5

> TODO: I am expecting to model simple computers (register machines), and maybe touch on compilers.
