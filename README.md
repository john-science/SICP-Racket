# SICP-Racket

Reading through the wonderful [SICP Textbook](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) Scheme


### [Chapter 1 - Building Abstractions with Procedures](Chapter_1_Abstractions_with_Procedures)

This chapter felt very much like an introduction to programming. Lots of philosophical talk trying to describe the difference between data and logic, and things of that sort. But there is also a nice introduction to Scheme here. And it was all a joy to read (most textbooks aren't this readable).

### [Chapter 2 - Chapter_2_Abstractions_with_Data](Chapter_2_Abstractions_with_Data)

This is a LISP, I am hoping to see lists.
