# SICP-Racket

Reading through the wonderful [SICP Textbook](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) Scheme


### [Chapter 1 - Building Abstractions with Procedures](Chapter_1_Abstractions_with_Procedures)

This chapter felt very much like an introduction to programming. Lots of philosophical talk trying to describe the difference between data and logic, and things of that sort. But there is also a nice introduction to Scheme here. And it was all a joy to read (most textbooks aren't this readable).

### [Chapter 2 - Chapter_2_Abstractions_with_Data](Chapter_2_Abstractions_with_Data)

More waxing philosophic here about the nature of data vs code. Very enjoyable. A wonderful introduction to data-driven software. Not just a good description of lists and trees, but also the kinds of decisions that need to be made when trying to design code to solve a more general problem. A great introduction to thinking like an engineer. Hell, they even introduced compression algorithms.
